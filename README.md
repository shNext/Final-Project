# Overview

Computer architecture class in university led me to change career from cybersecurity to software development. <br/>
And after learning embedded system course, I have interest in system architecture. <br/>

The biggest difference between embedded boards I used before and Vim3 Basic is that it has an NPU. <br/>
It's important to consider what kind of experience utilizing NPUs would be beneficial for job. <br/>
However, there was also content related to Secure Boot and TPM. <br/>
